    "A big push in astronomy nowadays is that big surveys go out and collect a ton of data. How much data do they collect? To put things in perspective Aaron Parson, the radio astronomy professor here has a project called HERA and he's looking at HI lines from the very first galaxies ever formed. He mentioned to us that in one night of observing he collects something like 250 Terabytes of data. That is a ton of data!!!! You can only imagine that other projects like the SDSS, Kepler, TESS, and the most anticipated James Webb Space Telescope, collect or will collect a similar amount. Thus, knowing how to handle data in any format is a crucial tool for an astronomer to have. You will be using these big data releases to answer any questions that you want to answer. Which you will explore in this weeks homework. The goal of this homework is to familiarize yourself with file-io particularly how to grab data from the files and how to use the data in these files to do some cool astronomy."

There we used a spectrometer (a fancy name for a device that splits up light into different wavelengths/frequencies and measures the intensity at each wavelength) to measure the intensities near the HI rest frequency line. But as is typical of all observations there are some errors coming in due to the equipment being used. Often times the signals are very weak and in order for us to see them they have to go through an amplifier so the signal can get boosted. However, this introduces noise into the signal. Another source of noise comes when we apply low pass and high pass filters; we can get a shape due to the filter that we do not want in our final signal. So this problem will teach you how to handle that and reduce the data down."
